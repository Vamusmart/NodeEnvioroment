//Solve these problems (again) in a Javascript file on VSCode.
//Additional Instruction:
//We need to develop the habit of putting all our global variables and arrays in objects instead of just stand alone, donâ€™t worry about doing the same for functions just yet. So for these solutions there should never be any variables or arrays just on their own - everything should be in an object.
//"1. arrange these array items in alphabetical order and log myArray to the console"
//let myArray = ["Elishka", "Dan", "Ashley", "Connor", "Ben"]

let myObject1 = {
    myArray: ["Elishka", "Dan", "Ashley", "Connor", "Ben"]
};

function orderMe(arr) {
    let ordedArray = arr.sort();
    console.log(ordedArray);
}

orderMe(myObject1.myArray);


//"2. Declare a variable as a string, and then split that string into an array of letters (check out string methods). Store the result in a new variable and log it to the console"

let myObject2 = {
    name: "Dan", 
  };
  
  console.log(myObject2.name.split(''));


//"3. Take the word 'codenation' and rearrange the letters in the word so they are in alphabetical order. Store the result in a new variable and log it to the console"
let myObject3 = {
    name: "codenation", 
  };
  
  console.log(myObject3.name.split('').sort());



//"4. Change 'Benjamin' into 'Ben'"
//start by storing the string 'Benjamin' in a variable (Remember to look up array methods)

let myObject4 = {
    name: "Benjamin", 
  };
  
  console.log(myObject4.name.slice(0, 3));

//"5. write a function that adds a fruit onto the end of an array"
//Use this array inside your function (just copy and paste it into your function body) let array1 = ["apple", "pear", "banana"]

module.exports = {
    orderMe
